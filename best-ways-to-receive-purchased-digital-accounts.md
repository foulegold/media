## **Automated Web Services for Instant Account Delivery**

The majority of online markets and vendors employ automated web services to facilitate instant delivery of bought accounts. These services automatically create and deliver login credentials the moment payment is made.

- **Login Credentials Are Sent** – The credentials either are displayed on the purchase page, emailed, or sent as part of an API response.
