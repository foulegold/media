# How to Integrate Crypto Payments into Your Website with an API

Accepting cryptocurrency as a payment method is no longer a trend — it's becoming a standard. From SaaS products to e-commerce stores, businesses worldwide are embracing crypto for its low fees, borderless transactions, and growing adoption. In this article, we’ll walk through how to integrate crypto payments into your website using a crypto payment API — with real-world examples and practical code snippets.

## Why Accept Crypto Payments?

Crypto payments offer several advantages for both businesses and customers:
- Lower transaction fees compared to traditional card processors
- No chargebacks — all transactions in crypto are irreversible
- Borderless: serve a global audience without currency exchange
- Fast settlements — some networks confirm in seconds

With the rise of stablecoins (like USDT and USDC), crypto becomes even more practical for day-to-day transactions.

## How Crypto Payment Processing Works

Here’s how a typical crypto payment workflow looks when using a dedicated [API](https://cryptadium.com/ru/api) service:

1. Create a payment invoice with specified amount, currency and commission.
2. Payment is confirmed by blockchain. 
3. Webhook notification is sent to your server for fulfillment.
4. Optionally, convert to stablecoin automatically through the Hedge option.

Unlike direct wallet transfers, using an API provides full automation, enhanced security, and monitoring capabilities.
