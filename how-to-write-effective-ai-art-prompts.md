# **How to write effective AI art prompts**

Creating interesting AI art starts with formulating precise and creative prompts. Whether it's for fun, or to create commercially valuable artwork, learning how to write good prompts helps you get the most out of the AI art canvas. At [https://cortexlab.app/](https://cortexlab.app/) we iterate on prompt techniques which help users create rich, descriptive, nuanced prompts to generate high-quality content.

AI art systems extrapolate meaning from textual descriptions and transform them into visual concepts. The better you describe what you want, the more thoughtfully and clearly, the better the computer can make a painting that sounds good to you that isn’t just nonsense. In this post, we’ll share some prompts and discuss tips and strategies to improve your ability to write them.

## **Basics to know about the AI Art Prompt Fund**

The development of high-quality prompts is based on a number of central principles:

- **Clarity** – Communicate clearly and clearly. Avoid vagueness.
- **Specifics** – How the scene looks: single man, two men, one woman etc. Style, lighting, composition and emotion.
- **Limits** – Set out what you don’t like (e.g., no text, not too much stuff going on in the background).
- **Contextual Tips** – Introduce thematic or story elements to hint at the atmosphere.

These fundamentals guarantee your prompts lead the AI with precision, walking the fine line between creativity and oversight.

## **Key Elements of High-Quality Prompt**

### **What Should You Include in Writing Prompts?**

| Prompt Component | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subject | Who or what is the main subject | “A serene golden retriever” |
| Adjectives and Mood | Words related to feelings, environment or style | “peaceful, early morning light, soft focus” |
| Art Style | Painting, digital or photo and also inspiration of an artist | “kind of in watercolor style” |
| Composition & Perspective | How it is framed, the POV angle and cropping | “close-up portrait with blurred background” |
| Color Palette | Setting the mood for color | “warm with some pastel” |

## **Nuanced Enhancement**

As you continue to sharpen your augmented reality vision, the full range of available technology will enable new and improved implementations of your cornerstones.

To further refine prompts:

- **Reference to Art Movement or Artist**: “In the manner of Impressionism” or “in the color of Van Gogh”
- **Incorporate Lighting Styles**: “dynamic rim light,” “soft lighting sample”
- **Specify Detail Level**: “detailed fur texture,” “specific allover floral patterns in the background”
- **Combine Contrasting Concepts**: “A futuristic city floating above a medieval village” — the juxtaposition inspires creativity.
- **Play the Emotional and Narrative Beats**: “Nostalgia and wonder,” “like it was telling a story of hidden magic.”

## **2 Example Prompt Transformations**

### **Basic Prompt:**

A cat sitting in a garden

### **Improved Prompt:**

A regal tabby cat sits elegantly among blooming roses at dawn, its fur wrapped gently with soft golden light, rendered in impressionist style painting with dreamy bokeh background

### **Breaking it down:**

- **Subject**: “regal tabby cat”
- **Place & Time**: “among roses flowering at sunrise”
- **Lighting**: “soft golden light”
- **Style**: “impressionist painting”
- **Background**: “dreamy bokeh”

## **Practical Writing Workflow**

Here's how to do it in three simple steps:

- **Brainstorm & Outline**
    - Articulate your central topic and purpose.
    - Ask: What mood? What style?
- **Draft & Refine**
    - Write a full detailed prompt.
    - Add negative constraints (for example, “no heavy shadows,” “no text overlay”).
- **Test & Iterate**
    - Create pictures, check answers.
    - Narrow down by adding or removing descriptors.

## **Bad Prompts: Steering the AI wrong**

What you don’t want is often just as important as what you do. Think down in a negative manner to avoid the negatives:

- **No cartoonish style**
- **Avoid overly dark shadows**
- **Exclude text labels or logos**

These exclusions will enable the AI to concentrate on what you want.

## **Maneuvering Between Creativity and Constraints**

Too tight, and you restrict artistic surprise; too loose, and you end up with randomness. Strike a balance:

- **Lead what’s important**
    
    If you happen to be forcing those steps anyway, other essentials that are key should be spelled out.
    
- **Leave the rest open for the model to decide**

**Example**: “A mysterious forest scene, misty, under moonshine; Let there be abstract shapes in the background”

This harmony stimulates creativity, and sustains a sense of consistency.

## **Quick Tips for Better Prompts**

- **The descriptors are divided by commas**
- **List style cues clearly**
- **Keep each adjective concise**
- **Resist the urge to say two things that clash, like “ultra-bright” or “no glare”**
- **Name drop a popular artist, art era, or medium**
- **Add some nuance — time of year, weather, emotion, time of day**

## **Prompt Styles Compared**

| Style Type | Example | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimalist Prompt | “Black cat, moonlight, low poly style” | One-liner synopsis, vague idea generation |
| Descriptive Prompt | “Majestic black cat under a full moon, moonlight shining on fur, dark low-poly 3D render” | Specific, polished visuals |
| Narrative Prompt | “A lone wanderer cat exploring a moonlit ancient forest, mystical glow, cinematic depth of field” | Emotional, story-driven scene |

## **When to Use Tables in Prompts**

Tables help to look forward or track your progress on something. However, when it comes to the AI, you have to find a way to support the structures. Better put it in your brainstorming tool than in the AI input.

## **Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them**

- **Oversaturation of adjectives** – simplify to keep the eye on target.
- **Vague concepts** — always know what “realistic” or “epic” actually is in your ideal.
- **Lights** – or the lack of it (lighting sets the mood).
- **Avoiding test iterations** – small adjustments can cause big swings.

## **Integration with Workflows**

- **Stage variants** (style, mood, subject) with a spreadsheet.
- **Make prompt templates** for common ideas.
- **Record effective prompts**, and then group them by style.

## **Sample Prompt Templates**

| Template Use Case | Template Example |
| --- | --- |
| Character Portrait | Head-to-toe illustration of [character], [mood adjective], [light], [style], [background description] |
| Landscape Scene | A beautiful vista of [location], [time of day], [weather], [art medium], [color palette], [atmospheric detail] |
| Surreal Composition | An artistic fusion of [element A] with [element B], [emotional beats], [style], [lighting add detail] |

## **FAQs**

### **What kind of prompt is an “effective” one for AI art?**

A good prompt is succinct, clear, descriptive and balanced — it should offer narrow enough guide(lines) (subject, style, mood, lighting), but let creativity enough room for the AI.

### **Just how many details are too many in a prompt?**

Provide enough detail to lead the result with authority — but not to micromanage. 5–10 unique descriptors tend to be a good number — more if you have a reason to use a lot.

### **Am I allowed to use artists as prompts?**

Yes. Citing an artist (say, “like Monet”) will help the A.I. toward a recognizable aesthetic — but hedge it with other terms.

### **What happens if the AI does not provide me with the response I wanted?**

Refine your prompt. Fill in the missing parts, or leave some out. Repeat until the output pleases your eye.

### **Is there value in using negative prompts?**

Absolutely. Negative prompts serve to further clean up the result and push it closer to the target you're aiming for.

### **Must different prompts be used with different models?**

Yes. Results will vary by individual AI art model. Edit for wording and style prompts as desired, and save your prompts with the model it best.

## **Conclusion**

As with any form of AI art, learning to generate strong AI art prompts takes time and hard work to master. With clarity, descriptive nuance, balanced constraints, and iterative refinement, you guide AI to make images to meet your nuanced specifications. Use the tables and templates provided on this page to help make your process easier and refine based on output. The possibilities with AI art are endless when you have thought provoking prompts.
