  <h1>RAID-10 SSD in Hosting</h1>

  <p>With digital presence growing, the preserving high hosting performance and data consistency have become a crucial fundaments for successful online businesses. With a range of technologies and excellent speed/redundancy combinations, the RAID-10 SSD is no doubt the best combination. This post goes into the details of why RAID-10 SSD is now so standard in web hosting systems — but particularly in environments such as <a href="https://www.en.ee/vps-servers/" target="_blank">VPS Europe</a> where supreme performance, availability and data protection are king.</p>

  <p>If you are a business owner who has a cloud-based website, e-commerce store or a SaaS platform, having a knowledge of RAID-10 can also help you in making the best decisions for your hosting requirements.</p>

  <h2>What is RAID-10 SSD Storage?</h2>

  <p>RAID-10, also known as RAID 1+0, combines RAID-0 and RAID-1 to offer high performance and good fault resistance. Featuring SSD caching for faster read/write speeds and data redundancy.</p>
  <p>For the setup, you will need a minimum of four SSDs. Half are used for mirroring, and the other half for striping.</p>

  <h2>How RAID-10 Offers More Data Redundancy and Ability to Boost I/O Performance</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mirroring provides redundancy</strong>: one disk mirrors another, so if one fails, the data is safe.</li>
    <li><strong>Striping increases speed</strong>: Data is split across multiple disks for faster reads and writes.</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum efficiency</strong>: Less power use, higher efficiency even in sleep mode.</li>
    <li><strong>High Resolution Audio</strong>: High-frequency response and lossless audio decoding.</li>
    <li><strong>SSD powerhouse</strong>: Faster system with greater storage efficiency.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Less Downtime</strong> - Even with 1 disk failed, mirrored drives continue hosting without interruption.</p>

  <h2>Why You Need RAID-10 Hosting Environment</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Low latency</strong>: Crucial for dynamic websites and apps.</li>
    <li><strong>Stable uptime</strong>: Keeps services running reliably.</li>
    <li><strong>High priority</strong>: Ideal for large data or streaming.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast data recovery</strong>: Recovers from disk failure quickly.</li>
  </ul>
