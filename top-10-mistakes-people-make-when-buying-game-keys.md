## **Top 10 Game Key Buying Mistakes**

### **Not Checking for Region Locks**

The most common complaint we receive is the buyer purchasing a region locked product key69.95 and receiving the error 0xc004e016 REGION_MISMATCH when activating. Now I will take the time to explain what this means as it tends to confuse quite a few people. A region locked product key means that upon activation, use or redemption; your code will only work within your given specific world wide region. So, if you activate with a us key but try and use in Europe ( Example: Korea Region ) then obviously its not going to work since you have activated an us product in another region. To clear up any confusion most products on offer state below them as they are listed which regions each code can be activated from! Region locked game key A region-locked key may not be activated or played from a territory other than the one specified. Customers are sometimes lured in by prices that seem too good to be true and don’t check to see if the hardware is compatible.

To avoid this, always verify:

- **The domain of validity of the key.**
- **If the device you are playing on does not support activation in your region.**

Dozens of sellers post their own limits in fine print. Failure to address these issues can render the game unplayable, and result in a waste of time and money.

### **Ignoring Revoked Codes Risk**

Some codes, even valid ones, will let them expire if there has been a revocation. That’s because they were acquired by sellers in unauthorized ways, like stolen credit cards or fake accounts. The yogscast keys in the past have been activated and then after a few days or weeks players find they are no longer available.

Legitimate marketplaces have mechanisms to identify suspiciously large purchases, and when spotted these keys are disabled. Regrettably, this problem is passed directly to the end user and there are no refunds.

Before purchasing, make sure the seller is known to trade only in legitimate codes.

### **Purchasing from Grey Markets Without Doing Your Homework**

Grey market resellers sell keys for less, sometimes with no clear sourcing. Not all black markets are necessarily illegal, but they may include:

- **Keys acquired through unauthorized resellers.**
- **Bulk purchases from low-cost regions.**
- **Codes associated with stolen credit-card numbers.**

The non transparency leads to potential fraud and account bans. If publishers have not said it's OK, stay off the platform.

### **Overlooking Platform Compatibility**

Another is not checking what platform the key itself is for. A Steam key will not work on Epic Games or Ubisoft Connect and so on.

Some players expect any digital key will work everywhere, and that’s not the case. Always check if the key is appropriate to the platform you are going to work with.

### **Sucked In by Prices That Are Too Good to Be True**

Free cesspools Some inexperienced buyers are reeled in by ultra-low prices. But if you spot a deal that seems too good to be true compared with national sources, it might be trouble. These are often “bargains” with stolen or unauthorized codes.

Rule of thumb: if the discount is above 70 per cent shortly following a game’s launch, proceed with caution.

### **Not Reading Seller Reviews**

In multi-vendor marketplaces, you better not ignore seller reviews. Common spin off comments include: slow delivery, invalid keys, or refusing to honor refunds.

Trustworthy seller with reliable reviews is certainly more credible than the one without ratings (or others) although this later is cheaper.

### **Skipping Refund Policies**

Note: Before you finish your purchase, always check the refund policy. Some third-party platforms leaving you with no option if the key is fake or used.

Without straightforward refund policies, the burden rests entirely on the consumer. Choose a seller that offer clear warranty.

### **Pre-order Keys vs Active-keys mixup**

Another trap relates to non-active pre-order keys. Buyers occasionally think that they will gain access instantly, only to find out they cannot play the game until its scheduled release date.

Make sure to verify if the key comes pre-activated or requires waiting for its launch date.

### **Not Verifying Payment Security**

Credit card information is at risk of being stolen from non-secure websites without thorough encryption. Typing personal or payment information into suspicious sites is a gateway to compromised date.

Look for indicators such as:

- **HTTPS in the URL.**
- **Accepted payment methods (PayPal, credit cards).**
- **Verified seller seals.**

### **Not Comparing Authorized Retailers In The First Place**

Before looking elsewhere, always double-check prices at authorized retailers. So-called official platforms regularly hold seasonal sales with risk-free reductions. It's really a gamble to site only on unchecked sources.

When buyers comparison shop, they often find legitimate bargains that are not at the expense of safety.
