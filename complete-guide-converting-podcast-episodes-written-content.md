## **Understanding Podcast Transcription Technology**

The technology of transcription has come on a long way since then.

## **Step-by-Step Conversion Process**

### **Preparing Your Audio File**

Converting your audio file for podcasting first, you need to choose and prepare an audio file of your podcast. Select episodes that have good evergreen content that can translate to written. Trim out any audio-only components, such as lengthy music interludes and sound effects that have no textual equivalent. Make sure that your audio file is in the sound file format, and does not exceed size restriction, accepted by a chosen transcription service.

### **Uploading and Processing**

Upload your ready audio file to the transcription service you have chosen. The most services accept MP3, WAV, M4A files. Upon upload, an automated transcription process usually initiates right away as it processes the audio and creates a transcript of the text. At this stage, the AI notes who is speaking, punctuates and puts in paragraph breaks as suggested by natural speech rhythms and pauses between speakers.

### **Reviewing and Editing**

Sit down for an intense review and rewriting session after your first reference transcript is created. Please listen to the audio, reading along with the transcript to make sure you catch and correct any typos, misspelled words, or missing words. Name all speakers if the system referred to them with generic names, out of context. This manual process preserves original content and guarantees accuracy, so you can use the text with confidence.

## **Turning Transcripts into Compelling Articles**

### **Editing and Refinement**

Unedited transcripts need a lot of work before it's turned into final articles. Everyday speech is filled with spoken fillers, repeats, false starts and conversationalistic detours that fly in audio but fail on the page. Take out that stuff, you know? But let's take it out and keep the heart of what they're saying, their real voice. Wordy run-on sentences become succinct sentiments that convey meaning in few words, yet without compromising on complexity.

### **Structuring Your Content**

Write a strong intro that applies what the prompt is asking for to your own point of view. Unlike podcast intros that can afford a more gradual introduction to the subject, written intros should clearly and quickly convey the value of the post, and press people on into it. Create succinct section titles to make content easy to read through that also makes sense of the text. These structural devices will make your text easier to read and help your readers locate needed information on the fly.

### **Enhancing with Additional Material**

Add-on the on-book content as extra material that is not just a rehash of the original podcast. Add to it the numbers, relevant statistics, & research studies or anything that further serves as an example lead or lend support without altering the core message. Use visuals (photos, charts, infographics) to help listeners picture some of the more complex topics discussed in the audio. References to reliable sources enhance the case and help establish credibility based on content.
