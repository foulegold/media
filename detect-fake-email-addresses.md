# **How to Detect Fake Email Addresses in Your Contact List**

In modern times, email marketing has remained one of the most effective tools businesses and individuals use to reach their audiences. However, quality in this regard is essential to keep your reputation and deliverability rates high. The case of prevalence in fake or bogus email addresses in your contact list would adversely affect the sender score because the sender score directly impacts how many of your emails will make their way to the inbox rather than the spam folder. Fortunately, that risk can be minimized quite easily by making use of a [Free Email Verifier](https://letsextract.com/email-verifier.htm) which will filter the bad addresses. That, however, is only one step in the process. The following article discusses tips on how to identify fake email addresses for protection of sender score and improvement in email marketing.

## **Why Detecting Fake Email Addresses Is Crucial**

Your sender score, in simple terms, is the reputation of your IP address. Basically, it's the rate at which ESPs decide whether your emails should end up in someone's inbox or spam box. Having a high hard bounce rate—the result of sending emails to fake or unverified addresses—lowers your sender score. When that happens, fewer of your valid emails will end up in the recipients' inboxes, which hurts your email marketing strategy.

### **Key Effects of a Low Sender Score:**

- **Higher bounce rates:** As the fake email addresses don't exist, your messages will bounce.
- **More chances of blacklisting:** Sending consistently to invalid emails can have the ESPs blacklist your domain.
- **Decreased deliverability:** The lower the sender score, the fewer emails will make it to your audience.
- **Reduced customer engagement:** Fewer emails are reaching the context, meaning your marketing is less effective.

Therefore, it is very important to keep your email list clean and accurate. Now let's get into some actionable ways how you can detect fake emails addressed to you.

## **Common Signs of Fake Email Addresses**

Before you can clean your contact list, you need to understand how to identify those fake email addresses. Following are some surefire signs the address might be bogus:

- **Unusual Domain Names:** Most valid email addresses contain common domain names like Gmail, Yahoo, or a company's domain. If you get an email with a weird or suspicious domain name, for example, @fakesite.com or @123mail.biz, it could well be a fake.
- **Random Character Strings:** These are often bot- or spam-generated email addresses, especially those with a combination of random letters, numbers, or symbols such as [abc123@xyz.com](mailto:abc123@xyz.com). In most cases, real people do not use this type of email address.
- **Disposable or Temporary Domains:** Services like TempMail or GuerrillaMail provide temporary email addresses that expire within a very short period of time. Addresses using such domains are most probably fakes and should be marked for removal.
- **Typo Squatting Domains:** Sometimes, spurious email addresses will spoof popular domains through common misspellings or slight variations—maybe something like @gmaail.com instead of @gmail.com. These domains can be malignant since they usually point to phishing scams.
- **Multiple Addresses from One Source:** For example, if you noticed your list had several addresses that were registered in bulk from the same source at nearly the same time, then this might uncover a portion of fake sign-ups.

## **Techniques for Identifying Fake Email Addresses**

While the above signs can help you find such fake emails manually, it is way more effective to use automated tools and processes. Following are some of the tried and tested techniques for finding invalid or fake email addresses in your contact list:

- **Use an Email Verification Tool:** One of the effective ways to trace fake email addresses is by using a free email verifier. These tools, in a different form or methodology, do the same thing: conducting automatic checks through various sets of tests—syntax checks, verification of domains, and response of mail servers—on a given email address. Free email verifiers can quickly detect whether an address is fake, misspelled, or undeliverable.
- **Confirmation on Double Opt-In:** When someone subscribes to your mailing list, you immediately send them an email and ask them to confirm that by clicking on a link that came into their inbox. In this way, you may be certain that the email address given is real and accessible. If the person never confirms this by clicking on the confirmation link, then it is probably a dummy subscription.
- **Regular Cleaning of Lists:** Regular cleaning of your email list will help you maintain a good sender score. Remove hard bounces, inactive subscribers, or other invalid emails to clean up your list periodically using an email validation tool.
- **Check for Role-Based Addresses:** These would typically include addresses based on roles, such as [info@domain.com](mailto:info@domain.com) or [support@domain.com](mailto:support@domain.com), which companies use but individual subscribers hardly ever use. Sometimes these may cause deliverability issues and may not add much value to your email engagement.
- **Improve Bounce Rates:** High bounce rates are a direct pointer that your list is full of phony or invalid email addresses. If you happen to notice that after a certain campaign is rolled out, the number of bounced emails is much higher than usual, investigate and remove the email addresses causing delivery failure.

## **How Spoofing Emails Hurt Your Email Campaigns**

Even a few fake email addresses on your list can have serious consequences for your campaigns. Here's how they can affect your overall email marketing efforts.

- **Increased bounce rate:** Emails sent to nonexistent addresses will be rejected, inflating your bounce rate and sending ESPs the signal that you are not maintaining your list.
- **Reputation Damage:** High bounce rates, spam complaints, and blacklisting after emailing phantom addresses will hurt your reputation with ESPs and lower the chances of your legitimate emails making it to the inbox.
- **Higher Costs:** The reason being, most email marketing platforms charge you based on the size of your list. By keeping those fake or cold addresses in your database, you inflate its scale and pay more for it without any return on investment.
