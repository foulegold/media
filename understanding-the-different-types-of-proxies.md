## **What is A Proxy?**

The proxy server serves as an intermediate source situated between the client's device and the internet. The proxy server accepts requests from the client, sends them to the target server, and passes on its response back to the client. This method has several advantages:

- **Anonymity**: Hides one's IP address to heighten confidentiality.
- **Security**: Blocks out malicious material and bars direct entry to the client's network.
- **Access Control**: Limits or permits access to certain sites or material.
- **Functionality**: Stores commonly used data, minimizing load times.

## **Personal Proxies**

- **Accessing geo-restricted material** without disruptions.

## **Batch Proxies**

### **Definition**

Batch proxies are a series of proxies offered at once, enabling users to toggle among them as required. They are commonly utilized in situations where multiple IP addresses are needed.

### **Benefits**

- **Scalability**: Handle large-scale operations effectively.
- **IP Rotation**: Minimizes risk of detection when performing automatic tasks.
